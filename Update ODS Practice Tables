https://digital.nhs.uk/services/organisation-data-service/data-downloads/gp-and-gp-practice-related-data
Copy into SQLdata_Import/IMPORT folder

Run CREATE_gppractice_copies.sql -- creates copies of ods_gppractices and ceg_gppractices under old_im schema
Run CREATE_odsgppractices.sql -- drops and creates ods_gppractices table, with varchar fields for import

Edit SQLdata_Import2.ps1
    to include your database settings under # Set Variables
    update the log file location, if needed
    set csv delimiter settings

Edit RUN_SQLdata_Import.ps1 to give
    SQLdata_Import2.psl location
    target table
    csv file location.

Run RUN_SQLdata_Import.ps1 -- Best to run from terminal, in order to see messages. Powershell may request Execution Policy Change to run script. Select Y.
Script calls SQLdata_Import to load each file into the table in the database 50000 rows at a time, using temporary memory tables.

Run FORMAT_field_datatypes.sql -- changes empty data to NULL and changes fields to appropriate datatypes.

Run UPDATE_organization_id_from_eoc.sql - adds in organization_id from episode_of_care table. (approx. 3mins)

A version updating from encounter table is also available.  Using episode_of_care means that only organisations in 'our patch' have an id. However, as organisations can have multiple ids as service providers, it could be a lottery as to which one ends up in the ods_gppractices.

Run UPDATE_ceggppractices.sql -- updates ceg_gppractice.organization_id and status from ods_gppractices

If not wanted, DROP the old gppractices tables now under old_im.
